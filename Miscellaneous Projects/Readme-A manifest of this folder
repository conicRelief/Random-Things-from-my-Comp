Web Development Section
	
	Polling Structure[Python]
		Basically a backend caching mechanism that exploits polling statistics to the end of saving consts on the use of 3rd party API's.
		Reduces transaction costs to about 12-25% of the unchaced polling. This project is more or less finished.

	Fleet Tracker[Web App]
		Ruby on rails project. First exposure to web dev. No front end frameworks. Everything is handled using Ajax, and javascript
		Requires Vinli Auth to run.  Basically tracks vehicles, their fuel levels.  
	Race-Android[Python/Javascript backend]
		Backend for android app prototype.  
		The mobile app is used to show a visual readout/minimap of a race track your vehicle is on.(Android Native, not included in this directory)
		The backend stores race track information for a racing app and replies with a track's JSON.
		Two  python scripts are responsible for datacurration.  One updates weather information cache. The other parses hand-drawn Google KML tracks for track information. Several distance formulas are used to calculate the distance of the race track.  

	Messing with meteor[Javascript]
		To-do list using meteor.js. Basically my take on meteor's standard tutorial
	
	Kobra Clone[HTML/CSS/Javscript]
		Unfinished. Front end UI stuff for a collaborative python interpreter. (kind of like google docs for python coding)	
		Idea is to concurrently persist edits, as well as offer interpretation of python code.


	Socketing /	Sockets[Java]
		Played around with sockets. 

	A spinning cube
		Part of a three.js tutorial. It is an artifact of an effort I made to play around with 3js a year ago.

NON Web Section

	crouching tiger hidden back-prop [Python]
		Innefficient implementation of neural nets. Inneficient because gradient matrices were hand calculated(did not know that theano had an auto-differentialtion function)

	Face recognition ala open cv [Python]
		Implemented haar cascades for facial recognition. Open CV did the recognition. The project was more about I building a personal Haar cascade. 

	Huffman Code implementation [Java]
		Built an implementation of Huffman Encoding Compression algorithm. This project is complete. No external libs used

	Nime Mens Morris AI [Java]
		Personal implementation of alpha beta pruning, and minimax advesarial search functions used to play a game of nine mens morris on a custom board configuration. No external libs used
